# Automated_Process
Automated process for investors to invest and withdraw.


The automated process should allow investors to select a product they are withdrawing from, 
capture the withdrawl amount, dates and banking details the money must be paid into. Once the withdrawl notice is completed, investors should receive a notification that shows them the balance before the withdrawl was made, the amount withdrawn and the closing balance.
